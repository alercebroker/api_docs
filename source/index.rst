ALeRCE API Documentation
====================================================

`ALeRCE <http://alerce.science/>`_ is a Chilean-lead alert broker for time-domain astronomy.

ALeRCE implements different services that can be accessed through APIs. These APIs are
for public use and most of them do not require authentication.

The APIs are currently being used in `ZTF-Explorer <https://alerce.online/>`_ and `SN Hunter <https://snhunter.alerce.online/>`_ .
